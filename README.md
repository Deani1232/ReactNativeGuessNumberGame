# ReactNativeGuessNumberGame
This is a simple app built with React Native that has the user input a number and then the phone tries to guess it with a random number.
It is created with Expo and React/React Native. It is an app that can be compiled to both IOS and Android.

## Features
- The user inputs a number which is validated to always be positive and between 1-99
- The phone will guess the number by selecting a random number
- The user inputs either higher or lower so that the phone can guess another number
- When the phone guesses the correct number, the app displays how many tries it took and what the final number was

## Credits
This app is created following Academind's React Native Course. All work provided here is a copy of the coursework, but has been replicated by myself with the intention of being a learning project. You can follow the course as well here: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide
